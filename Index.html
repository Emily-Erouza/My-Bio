<h2> 1.Why I joyed TCG(The Coding Ground) and What I love about Coding.</h2>
<p><b>I joined TCG: </b> Because there is an opportunity to learn coding. I was interested in learning coding.  I wanted to give it a try so that I can have some knowledge about coding and the other things that are happening on the internet and browser.
</p>
<p><b>What I love about coding:</b>
Its intersting and fun activity to do. You can create something that can be extremely useful to people that make their life and work easier.
 I love it because you can create something on stage no one else can do. You can also engage myself. Coding makes me think logically all the time. Creating something that didn't exist before.

<h2>2.When I am not coding</h2>
You will find me watching films. I enjoy the inspiration of Black Panther. It inspires me because death can be difficult to cope with, although it can take a loved one away unexpectedly.

<h2>3.My Strengths</h2>
 <p><b>My greatest strength is my empathy</b> my ability to relate to people and understand their needs.</p>
<p><b>My second strength is my writing skills</b> I always have faith in my writing, also reading helps me to understand literature better. It helps me to put myself into someone else's shoes and better  understand other perspectives.

<h2>4.My Growth area</h2>
<p><b>Listening in the workplace.</b>
During a meeting I may lose focus, so I bring my notebook to write questions that I don't understand, it helps me to remember the information. I try to understand what someone is saying before searching for a deeper meaning. I like to recharge my body and mind. When I am going to have a long meeting. I get some light exercise like walking or stretching to get my blood flowing and it makes me feel awake. Getting some fresh air boosts my energy level and helps me to stay focused.

<p><b>Stress management.</b> 
I experience stress at some point during coding, and knowing how to effectively manage it can prevent and  decrease my productivity and increase my motivation to move through the stress in a healthy  way. At some point, I feel a lot of pressure when there is too much work we should do. There are some common workplace stressors which are work that isn't engaging or challenging and  lack of social support.  Sometimes I can have problems such as headache, short temper, sleep disturbance and difficulty concentrating. So I usually take a few minutes each day to focus on a simple activity like breathing, walking and  enjoying my favourite meal.
